The solution code for the problem is 'solution.py' file.

In there, 'data.csv' file was used to train the model.

In that code we have got predictions for data in 'testdata.csv'. This is the dataset which was in kaggle competition.

You can see the whole dataset with the resulted predictions in "predictions.csv" file.
This file is created once you run the code in "solution.py" file.

When you run 'solution.py', see and keep closing the figures apearing. 
At the end, you will get the predicted results in the command line, as well as the "predictions.csv" file is created.The predicted result is in the 
last column of it.
